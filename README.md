## The Cli-Art-Generator

I'd like to add another lower level language to my skills and this is a little experiment for me to get a bit of a fell for C++ and Rust.

I first created a simple cli generative art program. (Emphasis on the simple). A string or four characters are inputted and out spits a grid of those characters randomly chosen.

Once the Javascript version was done, I then went on to convert this code to C++ and then to Rust.
